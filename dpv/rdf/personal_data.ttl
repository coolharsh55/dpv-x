    rdfs:comment "It is advised to carefully consider indicating data is fully or completely anonymised by determining whether the data by itself or in combination with other data can identify a person. Failing this condition, the data should be denoted as PseudoAnonymisedData. To indicate data is anonymised only for a specified entity (e.g. within an organisation), the concept AnonymisedDataWithinScope (as subclass of PseudoAnonymisedData) should be used instead of AnonymisedData."@en ;
