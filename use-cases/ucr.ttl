ucr:U2 a ucr:UseCase ;
    dct:description "There are a vast number of concepts associated with data processing, with differences and variations across jurisdictions, domains, and sectors. A common dictionary of concepts with information on how they relate to other concepts across such differences would be an invaluable resource on its own. This could be a simple list, a dictionary, or a thesauri." ;

ucr:R2 a ucr:Requirement ;
    dct:description "The encapsulation of concepts must be in a form that is machine-readable, consistent, and using a formal specification - ideally a standard. This will ensure the concepts are correctly parsed, interpreted, and used by machines across use-cases, and will assist in the automation of information and information-based tasks." ;

ucr:U3 a ucr:UseCase ;
    dct:description "The concepts associated with a particular task can be considered the vocabulary necessary for representing information for that particular task. For example choosing the appropriate legal basis requires the concept associated with legal basis as well as the specific legal bases that can be utilised. In order to assist in providing the appropriate contextual vocabulary, the concepts should be encoded in a form that can be automatically queried or retrieved depending on the context." ;
