        <blockquote><strong>Release Candidate</strong> While this is a regular 0.x style release, it also acts as the v1.0 release candidate. This means if there are no major issues raised and unable to be resolved, including missing parts, errors or bugs, or requirements that must be added, then after 15-OCT-2022, this version will be re-released as DPV v1.0 along with any further enhancements, fixes, minor additions, or documentations that have been developed until then.</blockquote>

        <p>v0.5 introduces the DPV-PD extension which consists of concepts moved from DPV's personal data categories to a separate namespace to avoid collisions with non-personal-data concepts with the same name.</p>
