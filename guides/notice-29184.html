        <p>The <a href="https://www.iso.org/standard/70331.html">ISO/IEC 29184:2020 Information technology — Online privacy notices and consent</a> specifies requirements for privacy notices provided online and used for consent to enable individuals to understand and control the potential impact of the processing of their personal data and its consequences. This document provides a guide for the implementation of machine-readable privacy notices based on the information and requirements defined in ISO/IEC 29184:2020 by using the <a href="https://w3id.org/dpv">Data Privacy Vocabulary (DPV)</a>. The goal of such machine-readable notices is to enable a better mechanism for the communication and use of privacy notices, and to enable entities to keep records of notices in a consistent manner. Where ISO/IEC 29184:2020 only considers notices for consent, this document expands the scope to define notices used for all legal bases. Additionally, this document also provides guidance on using ISO/IEC 29184:2020 for meeting <a href="https://eur-lex.europa.eu/eli/reg/2016/679/art_7/oj">EU GDPR</a> requirements regarding privacy notices.</p>

<h1 class="title">Mapping 29184 to DPV</h1>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>notice can be used for different applications
<ul class="org-ul">
<li><code>dpv:Notice</code> with <code>dpv:PrivacyNotice</code>, <code>dpv:ConsentNotice</code> (present) as subclasses
of <code>dpv:Notice</code></li>
</ul></li>
<li>notice can be for specific audiences
<ul class="org-ul">
<li><code>dpv:Recipient</code> with <code>dpv:hasRecipient</code> (where recipient indicates which
entities are the intended recipients of the notice)</li>
</ul></li>
<li>notice must provide identity of controller
<ul class="org-ul">
<li><code>dpv:DataController</code> with <code>dpv:hasDataController</code> as the IRI of the controller</li>
<li>legal identity includes name - <code>dpv:hasName</code>, or a legally recognised
identifier - <code>dpv:hasIdentifier</code></li>
</ul></li>
<li>notice must provide contact details of the controller and/or a contact point
<ul class="org-ul">
<li><code>dpv:hasContact</code> with <code>dpv:DataController</code></li>
<li>if the data controller is not the contact point, <code>dpv:Representative</code> with
<code>dpv:hasRepresentative</code> should be used with <code>dpv:hasContact</code> to describe contact
details of the representative</li>
<li>To describe the kind of contact point e.g. telephone, social media, email -
use <code>schema:ContactPoint</code> instance with associated properties</li>
</ul></li>
<li>notice must provide address of the controller
<ul class="org-ul">
<li><code>dpv:hasAddress</code> to describe address (legal address i.e. the postal address
associated with the Controller)</li>
<li>to describe further details in the address e.g. postal code, use
<code>schema:address</code> relation with instance of <code>schemaPostalAddress</code></li>
</ul></li>
<li>notice should be provided in an accessible manner appropriate to technologies
and audience
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>other than design UI/UX implementation, <a href="https://www.w3.org/2021/a11y-discov-vocab/latest/">Schema.org Accessibility Properties</a>
can be used to declare accessibility modes as metadata</li>
</ul></li>
<li>notice must be provided in appropriate language(s)
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>language is indicated using <code>dct:language</code></li>
<li>for multiple languages, each language should be declared with <code>dct:language</code>
and multilingual labels should be provided as appropriate to the technology
e.g. using string with language tag in RDF</li>
<li>alternatively, different versions of the notice should be created specific
for each language e.g. 1.0.0-en, 1.0.0-de</li>
</ul></li>
<li>the timing for presenting the notice should be indicated and documented - here
timing means the specific event when the notice is presented
<ul class="org-ul">
<li><code>dpv:isBefore</code> to indicate the notice is before something (e.g. collection)</li>
<li><code>dpv:isDuring</code> for notice during data collection</li>
<li><code>dpv:isAfter</code> for notice after data collection</li>
<li>to indicate notice is before/during/after some processing or service, the
object or value of the relation should be an appropriate concept
e.g. <code>dpv:isBefore dpv:Collect</code> means the notice is before data collection,
and <code>dpv:isAfter dpv:Share</code> means the notice is after data sharing</li>
<li>notice provided at location e.g. for CCTV operation should select the
appropriate context e.g. if the notice is provided outside the premises then
<code>dpv:isBefore dpv:Collect</code> is appropriate, whereas if the CCTV is in operation
where the notice is present then <code>dpv:isDuring dpv:Collect</code> is appropriate</li>
</ul></li>
<li>the location for presenting the notice should be indicated and documented -
where location can be physical or virtual
<ul class="org-ul">
<li><code>dpv:hasLocation</code> should be used to indicate location</li>
<li>where location can be a string representing contextual information
e.g. outside the shop, or a url indicating the website or webpage</li>
</ul></li>
<li>to enable comprehension of all information, the notice should be provided in a
form that aids in understanding the summary first and then having additional
details as needed, which can be achieved using different UX components
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>This should be represented using different subclasses of the notice:</li>
<li><code>dpv:LayeredNotice</code> for notices that are layered</li>
<li><code>dpv:DashboardNotice</code> for notices that are provided in a dashboard</li>
<li><code>dpv:JITNotice</code> for when notices are provided just-in-time</li>
<li><code>dpv:GraphicNotice</code> for when notice is provided as a set of graphic or UX
components, including icons</li>
</ul></li>
<li class="off"><code>[&#xa0;]</code> "may provide notices in a machine-readable format so that the software
presenting it to the data subject can parse it to optimize the user interface
and help data subjects make decisions"
<ul class="org-ul">

<li>first layer: anything unexpected or things that significantly impact the
data subject (what is unexpected? what is significant impact? - see 5.3.3)</li>
<li>first layer: should be able to be read quickly - should only be a summary</li>
<li>other layers: all collection and processing activities</li>
<li>to represent this, concepts are needed to represent the summary and
subsequent layers ; this can be done with a new concept called
<code>dpv:NoticeLayer</code> with subclasses <code>dpv:NoticeSummaryLayer</code> and

<li>the ordering between layers is indicated by using <code>dct:hasPart</code> i.e. each
layer leading to a different layer uses <code>dct:hasPart</code> - which means layers can
be a circular graph and are not necessarily an acyclic graph</li>

    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <section>
    <h3>Privacy Notices</h3>
    <p><i>Privacy Notices</i>, also known more commonly but incorrectly as <i>privacy policies</i>, are an important artefact for ensuring transparency, accountability, and to support decision making by individuals - such as for informed consent. Privacy and data protection laws such as [[EU-GDPR]] require and regulate such notices by defining requirements for information to be provided in certain situations. While such requirements may not necessarily specify the term 'notice', it is understood that any information provided from one entity to another is in the form of a notice.</p>
    
    <p>The intent of a notice is to inform an entity, and the information present in the notice refers to the intended information to be conveyed. Privacy notices provide information about matters pertaining to privacy - in this case regarding the processing of personal data, involved entities, risks, and consequences of the specified processing. Such notices can also contain additional information for convenience - such as links to further information or where to exercise specific actions and rights.</p>

    <p>As privacy notices communicate information of importance to the individual and are also often the subject of obligations, organisations are required to keep records of notices - such as to demonstrate which information was provided along with the why, when and where. Where the information in a notice changes, e.g. the duration of storing personal data or whom it is being shared with, a new updated notice may be required to be provided to the entity. The records of notices are also required to reflect such changes, and to maintain all such different versions of notices so that it is clear which notice was in effect at a given period in time.</p>
    
    <p>[[[ISO-29184]]] is a <a href="https://www.iso.org/deliverables-all.html#IS"><i>International Standard</i> (IS)</a> that "specifies controls which shape the content and the structure of online privacy notices as well as the process of asking for consent to collect and process personal data". The specification lists <i>information fields</i> that represent specific information associated with the privacy notice, and requirements over the form this information can take e.g. when to display it, how to group it, and whether it is mandatory or optional to be present. A <i>[[ISO-29184]] conformant</i> implementation is one that fulfils all requirements by either providing all information in the manner prescribed in [[ISO-29184]], or by storing information in a form that can be converted or transformed to fulfil its requirements.</p>

    <p>While [[ISO-29184]] only defines how the information is structured, presented, and used in privacy notices and its corresponding UI/UX elements and processes, it also allows for changes to made to the information and presentation mechanisms, for example to suit and match domain-specific labels or descriptions, or to introduce additional fields or information types that are needed. To ensure such changes are interoperable and useful for entities, they are documented with relevant information in the form of <i>schemas</i> or <i>profiles</i>. Such schemas or profiles are still required to be compatible with the requirements of [[ISO-29184]], such as by requiring the same fields to be mandatory. This document, referred to as [[DPV-29184]], defines a schema or profile of [[ISO-29184]] by defining a machine-readable representation of privacy notices through the use of [[DPV]].</p>

    <p>Machine-readable notices can be used to store records of notices - such as when it was sent or received so that there is proof of the notice and its contents. Machine-readable notices can also be used to communicate the information between entities such that the sender only specifies the information in the notice and the recipient can create their own visual or other representations of the notice. This is stark contrast to conventional forms of notices where the recipient only sees a pre-conceived visual form of the notice (think cookie/consent dialogues on websites) and does not have any options to tweak or customise the notice for their convenience. The conventional method also involves the sender having to make efforts to ensure the notice is adherent to regulatory or other requirements for presentation (think requiring both accept/reject buttons) and must also perform work to ensure the notice is accessible (think structuring the notice for specific groups). While [ISO-29184] does not state any such 'benefits' of machine-readable notices and only considers what should be in a notice and how it is presented, this document provides the argument for implementing them based on the perceived benefits to the ecosystem.</p>

        <h3>Objectives</h3>
        <p>The following are the objectives of this document:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>To introduce [[ISO-29184]] for [[DPV]]] audiences.</li>
            <li>To provide a mapping of [[ISO-29184]] to [[DPV]] concepts.</li>

            <li>To provide examples and guidance for the use of [[DPV-29184]].</li>
        </ol>
    </section>

    <section id="scope">
        <h3>Scope</h3>
        <p>The scope of this document is defined as follows:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>The implementation of [[DPV-29184]] expands on the scope in [ISO-29184] to consider notices for any legal bases rather than only consent.</li>
            <li>Maintaining records of notices or decisions of notices is outside of the scope of this document - those interested in privacu notices for consent should refer to the work documented in [[[DPV-27560]]].</li>
            <li>[[DPV-29184]], like [[ISO-29184]] and [[DPV]] is intended to be jurisdiction-agnostic. Use of specific jurisdictional concepts and requirements such as those provided in this document for [[EU-GDPR]] require the use of appropriate DPV extensions such as [[EU-GDPR]].</li>
            <li>[[DPV-29184]] is limited to the representation of information required to create notices based on the [[ISO-29184]] requirements. The security, communication, and maintenance of this information between entities to create and use such notices is outside the scope of this document beyond the examples provided.</li>
            <li>[[DPV-29184]], unlike [[ISO-29184]], is intended to facilitate interoperability of information and to ensure the required information is available in a form that can be used for its verification of conformance and compliance. Information described using [[DPV-29184]] can be maintained in a compatible form by an organisation for purposes such as alignment with internal terminology, processes, and technologies. Describing such compatible implementations beyond the guidance provided is outside the scope of this document.</li>
        </ul>
    </section>

    <section id="terminology">
        <h3>Terminology</h3>
        <p>The terminology used in [[ISO-29184]], [[EU-GDPR]], and [[DPV]] differ in <i>terms or labels</i> used, but largely represent similar <i>semantic concepts</i>. For example, ISO terminology uses <i>PII</i> for <i>Personally Identifiable Information</i>, which is similar to <i>personal data</i> in GDPR and DPV. This guide uses the [[DPV]] terminology unless referring to specific fields or terms used in a particular document. To assist with understanding and applying the terminologies across these three sources, [[[#terms]]] provides a summary table mapping the terms.</p>

    <h2>Overview of Notices in DPV</h2>
    <!-- <p>The concepts <a href="https://w3id.org/dpv#ConsentRecord">`Consent Record`</a> and <a href="https://w3id.org/dpv#ConsentReceipt">`Consent Receipt`</a> are defined in [[DPV]] as <a href="https://w3id.org/dpv#OrganisationalMeasure">`Organisational Measures`</a> to indicate their use in activities involving processing of personal data. This follows the principles of transparency and accountability based on diligent record keeping.</p>
    <p><a href="https://w3id.org/dpv#Consent">`Consent`</a> is a category of <a href="https://w3id.org/dpv#LegalBasis">`Legal Basis`</a> in [[DPV]], with specialised concepts extending it to describe types of consent, such as <a href="https://w3id.org/dpv#ExpressedConsent">`Expressed Consent`</a> and <a href="https://w3id.org/dpv#ExplicitlyExpressedConsent">`Explicitly Expressed Consent`</a>. To associate consent as a legal basis, the relation <a href="https://w3id.org/dpv#hasLegalBasis">`has Legal Basis`</a> is used with the appropriate consent concept.</p>
    <p><a href="https://w3id.org/dpv#ConsentStatus">`Consent Status`</a> represents information regarding the stage at which the process of obtaining, using, and maintaining consent is currently at. DPV provides categories of statuses based on practical requirements, for example - <a href="https://w3id.org/dpv#ConsentRequested">`Consent Requested`</a>, <a href="https://w3id.org/dpv#ConsentGiven">`Consent Given`</a>, and <a href="https://w3id.org/dpv#ConsentWithdrawn">`Consent Withdrawn`</a>. To indicate the status of consent, the relation <a href="https://w3id.org/dpv#hasConsentStatus">`has Consent Status`</a> is used with the appropriate consent status concept.</p>
    <p>To express how consent or an action associated with consent was indicated (or given or obtained), the relation <a href="https://w3id.org/dpv#hasIndicationMethod">`has Indication Method`</a> is used. To express the time, the relation <a href="https://w3id.org/dpv#isIndicationTime">`is Indication Time`</a> is used. To express the entity expressing the action, the relation <a href="https://w3id.org/dpv#isIndicatedBy">`is Indicated By`</a> is used.</p>
    <p>To indicate details about the consent, such as which data subject it is about, or the processing activities and entities associated with it, the relevant concepts and relations are to be reused. For example, <a href="https://w3id.org/dpv#hasDataSubject">`has Data Subject`</a> relation with <a href="https://w3id.org/dpv#DataSubject">`Data Subject`</a> concept indicates the data subject or individual who is the subject of the consent. Similarly, <a href="https://w3id.org/dpv#hasPurpose">`has Purpose`</a> with <a href="https://w3id.org/dpv#Purpose">`Purpose`</a> indicates the purpose of processing personal data, and <a href="https://w3id.org/dpv#hasDataController">`has Data Controller`</a> with <a href="https://w3id.org/dpv#DataController">`Data Controller`</a> indicates the entity responsible for the processing. Further information on the concepts and relations relevant to [[ISO-29184]] is summarised in [[[#terms]]], and is provided in [[DPV]] specification.</p> -->

      <p>The table below provides a comparison between the terms and concepts used in [[ISO-29184]], [[EU-GDPR]], and [[DPV]]. It is neither exhaustive nor authoritative, and is provided as an informative resource to better understand and apply the concepts as they are expressed in the two normative documents ([[ISO-29184]] and [[EU-GDPR]]). The column <i>req.?</i> reflects whether having this information is mandatory or optional. Where the value of this is expressed as a dash (<tt>-</tt>) it means <i>not applicable</i> to reflect the concept is not present or is covered by another term in the table. Note that for GDPR, the table only reflects the information to be maintained as specified in Art.13 and Art.14, and does not cover any specific requirements such as the validity of consent as per Art.4-11 or application of principles in Art.6 as these are outside the scope of [[ISO-29184]].</p>

        <h4>Additional Metadata</h4>
        <p>Information such as who maintains or published the record, when was it created or modified, and its provenance is not covered by [[ISO-29184]] as it is considered "implementation detail". To assist in maintaining this information, the following fields from [[DC-TERMS]] are suggested for documenting this information in an optional and non-normative manner:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><code>dct:accessRights</code>: information on who can access the consent record.</li>
            <li><code>dct:contributor</code>: entity or entities that have contributed to the information within the consent record.</li>
            <li><code>dct:created</code>: date/time for when the consent record was created.</li>
            <li><code>dct:creator</code>: entity that created the consent record. NOTE: this entity may be different from the publisher of the consent record, e.g. a processor (creator) manages the record for a controller (publisher).</li>
            <li><code>dct:hasPart</code> (with inverse <code>dct:isPartOf</code>): to associate with a part of the consent record, e.g. where the information in a consent record may be maintained separately or partitioned based on common information for efficiency.</li>
            <li><code>dct:hasVersion</code> (with inverse <code>dct:isVersionOf</code>): to associate one consent record with its updated version, e.g. where each event in a consent record results in a new consent record.</li>
            <li><code>dct:replaces</code> (with inverse <code>dct:isReplacedBy</code>): to associate the consent record which is being replaced, e.g. where the other consent record is no longer in use and this is a new consent record intended to replace it.</li>
            <li><code>dct:issued</code>: date/time associated with 'formal issuance' of the consent record, e.g. where <code>dct:created</code> is a timestamp for when the record was generated by a machine agent and where <code>dct:issued</code> captures its formal acceptance as a legally relevant record.</li>
            <li><code>dct:modified</code>: date/time for when the consent record was modified.</li>
            <li><code>dct:provenance</code>: information about the provenance of the consent record, e.g. where the record has been transferred between entities.</li>
            <li><code>dct:publisher</code>: entity or entities that 'publish' the consent record i.e. make it available within some contextual sense, e.g. to produce it within an audit or legal investigation.</li>
            <li><code>dct:source</code>: information on the sources used within the consent record, e.g. other records or logs that should be associated to record the provenance of information.</li>
            <li><code>dct:valid</code>: date/time until when this record can be considered valid. NOTE: this refers to assessing validity of the record as a whole and does NOT refer to validity of consent events or the processing specified within the record.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Further, the use of [[[vocab-dcat-3]]] is also recommended to store consent records and receipts as it assists with metadata fields (see above) as well as expressing relations between collections of records/receipts (i.e. catalogues) and relations between datasets (e.g. latest version).

        <h4>Notice</h4>
        <p>This field <strong>MUST</strong> be present.</p>
        <p>Reference to the specific version of the notice (`privacy_notice` in [[ISO-29184]]) associated with consent, indicated using `dpv:hasNotice` and a reference to the notice or an instance of `dpv:ConsentNotice`. If there are multiple notices - then each must be indicated separately. Multiple notices can be associated where such notices are part of the same context e.g. shown one after the other, or where they are associated over time, e.g. one notice shown initially when requesting and another when re-confirming it at a later time.</p>
        <div class="note" title="Distinction between Privacy Notice and Consent Notice">
            <p>In DPV, the concepts `dpv:PrivacyNotice` and `dpv:ConsentNotice` have different intended meanings - a consent notice is a specific privacy notice associated with consent, most commonly providing information in order to request consent. Whereas, a privacy notice can also refer to other documents providing information, such as what is commonly called as 'privacy policy'. For the purposes of the consent record, both documents can be included, but `dpv:ConsentNotice` MUST be used when referring to the notice used for providing information for consent.</p>

    <h3>Processing Fields</h3> 
    <p>[[ISO-29184]] contains 22 fields related to processing activities, and 5 additional fields regarding personal data involved in processing. The structuring of these fields within [[ISO-29184]] is of the form where the "PII Processing" section contains an array of "purposes" where each "purpose" is expressed with its own fields regarding legal basis, collection method, storage locations, and so on. Within the DPV implementation, this is replaced with <a href="https://w3id.org/dpv#Process">dpv:Process</a> so that each instance represents a distinct processing activity with its fields e.g. purposes, personal data, recipients.</p>

        <h4>Process</h4>
        <p>This field <strong>MUST</strong> be present.</p>
        <p>`dpv:Process` is a concept that represents a process or 'unit' for combining relevant details such as purposes, processing, personal data categories, recipients, and so on. Instances of `dpv:Process` can be used to differentiate between information regarding processing - such as where different purposes are used or that lead to different recipients. Such instances can also be nested within other instances to create a 'modular' structuring of processing activities.</p>
        <div class="note" title="Benefits of using `dpv:Process`">
            <p>Following the [[ISO-29184]] model requires creating a concept called 'purposes' and to utilise an array or a list to hold the associated 'purpose' instances. Given that DPV prefers a strict taxonomy expressed in a graph representation, following the same model would lead to non-intuitive structures. Further, other similar lists such as those for 'pii_type' also require creation of new concepts to represent groups or collections of the actual intended concepts.</p>

        <p>This field <strong>MUST</strong> be present.</p>
            <p>The purpose of processing personal data, expressed in DPV using <code>hasPurpose</code> as an instance of <code>Purpose</code>.</p>
            <p>[[ISO-29184]] has an additional field called 'purpose_type' that describes the category of the purpose. In DPV, this is declared by using concepts from the purpose along with <a href="http://purl.org/dc/terms/type">dct:type</a>. For additional information, such as descriptions, relevant DCT relations should be used.</p>
            <div class="note" title="Interpreting multiple purposes within a single context">
                <p>Where multiple purposes are present within the same or single context, for example the consent record or a personal data handling instance, the interpretation is that they are all applicable for that context. For example, if a personal data handling instance contains 3 purposes - then it is presumed that the consent is for carrying out each of the 3 purposes.</p>
                <p>To declare that ALL purposes must occur together i.e. they cannot be carried out independently, the appropriate semantic relations should be used to express this information - for e.g. by declaring the 3 required purposes as the 'type' for a new combined purpose.</p>
                <p>Caution is advised when modelling consent as jurisdictional requirements such as those from GDPR e.g. Recital 32 states "Consent should cover all processing activities carried out for the same purpose or purposes. When the processing has multiple purposes, consent should be given for all of them.". This means all purposes listed within a record pertaining to a single consent are to be used with that single consent as the legal basis.</p>

            <p>The personal data ('pii information' in [[ISO-29184]]) involved in processing activities, associated using <code>dpv:hasPersonalData</code> and instances of <code>dpv:PersonalData</code>.</p>
            <p>In [[ISO-29184]], the personal data fields are used to describe aspects of personal data as - type, identifier, optionality, being sensitive and being special category. In the DPV implementation, these are described as annotations or additional relations over the personal data instance.</p>
            <h5>Personal Data Type</h5>
            <p>This field <strong>MUST</strong> be present.</p>
            <p>The type or category of personal data ('pii type' in [[ISO-29184]]), expressed in DPV using <a href="http://purl.org/dc/terms/type">dct:type</a>, and optionally using concepts from the [[PD]] taxonomy. The value for this field must use a data category from DPV either through an explicit declaration i.e. using <a href="http://purl.org/dc/terms/type">dct:type</a> or through an implicit definition e.g. [[PD]] taxonomy. </p>

            <h5>Personal Data Necessity</h5>
            <p>This field MAY be present.</p>
            <p>The necessity or optionality of this data ('pii optional' in [[ISO-29184]]) for the processing, expressed in DPV using <code>hasNecessity</code> and one of the provided instances of <code>Necessity</code>. If this field is absent, it should be inferred as the data being necessary.</p>
            <aside class="example" title="Example specifying identifier of personal data">
                <p>Here, the identifier refers to a row ID within some internal database. The use of identifier in this case is to avoid exposing the actual email address within the consent record.</p>
                <pre><code>{

    }
}</code></pre>
                <p>Necessity (or Optionality) can also be expressed at broader contexts, such as for the entire personal data handling instance. This has the advantage over [[ISO-29184]] in that some purpose or processing could also be stated to be necessary or optional. In such cases, the expressed necessity is to be applied to ALL concepts within that instance. In the below example, the first instance has both purpose (communication) and personal data (email) as required or necessary, and the second has both (marketing, name) as optional.</p>
                <pre><code>{
    "@id": "https://example.com/a6f58318-72e6-46a2-bfd7-f36d795e30cd",

    }]
}</code></pre>
                <p>In the absence of a necessity statement, the default interpretation should be that the necessity is <code>dpv:Required</code>. In the below example, both instances have the necessity required even when only one of them explicitly declares it. As good practice, it is always better to specify the necessity explicitly to avoid confusion.</p>

            <h5>Sensitive and Special Category</h5>
            <p>This field MAY be present.</p>
            <p>Indicates whether the personal data is considered sensitive ('sensitive pii category' in [[ISO-29184]]), and separately whether it is also of special category ('special pii category' in [[ISO-29184]]). Declaring either in DPV is done using <a href="http://purl.org/dc/terms/type">dct:type</a> with value <code>SensitivePersonalData</code> or <code>SpecialCategoryPersonalData</code>. Its absence indicates the data does not belong to either sensitive or special categories.</p>
            <aside class="example" title="Example specifying personal data belonging to sensitive and special categories">
                <p>Being sensitive or special category is equivalent to defining it as the 'type' of data in DPV. Therefore, the notation for declaring type and sensitive is the same. In the below example, the first instance is sensitive, the second of special category, and the third is neither.</p>

        <h5>Data Source(s)</h5>
        <p>This field MAY be present.</p>
        <p>This field represents the source of data being processed. In [[ISO-29184]], this field is called <i>collection method</i> and can be about The data provided by or observed from activities of the data subjects, be inferred from existing data, or be collected from another entity or third party. In DPV, this information is represented using <code>dpv:DataSource</code> and associated using <code>dpv:hasDataSource</code>.</p>
        <p>Concepts within the DPV taxonomy have an exact meaning - for example data being obtained through observation should not be stated as being <i>collected</i>, but as <i>observed</i> - even if the data source is still the same data subject. Therefore, it is best to separate the data source <i>entity</i> and the <i>processing operation</i>.</p>

        <h5>Geographic Restriction(s)</h5>
        <p>This field MAY be present.</p>
        <p>Geographic restrictions are defined in [[ISO-29184]] as restrictions related to geo-locations or jurisdictions. While DPV prefers a declarative interpretation where, for e.g., if processing location is mentioned as EU then it implies that processing will only take place within EU since no other locations are mentioned. If the intention is to explicitly state this as a restriction, it can utilise the <code>dpv:Rule</code> concept which provides (simplified) Permissions, Prohibitions, and Obligations. For further expressiveness of complexity, specifications such as [[[odrl-model]]] should be considered.</p>
        <p>Note that while [[ISO-29184]] only considers restrictions over geographic locations for processing (including storing), DPV (and ODRL)support specifying information and restrictions over a much wider range of concepts. In theory, restrictions can be expressed over any concept or combination of concepts.</p>
        <aside class="example" title="Example specifying geographic restrictions on the processing of personal data">
            <p>The below example expresses that data must be stored within EU. Note that DPV's concepts do not support expressing negations i.e. we cannot state data must <i>not</i> be stored within <i>non-EU</i> locations. Also note the ambiguity in interpreting DPV's obligation as meaning either data must only be stored in EU or must at least be stored in EU (in addition to elsewhere). An alternative to this is to utilise an appropriate vocabulary such as [[ODRL]] - as in the second rule below, or as a last resort to use plain text - which is less desirable.</p>

        <h4>Legal Basis</h4>
            <p>This field MAY be present.</p>
            <p>The legal basis (lawful basis in [[ISO-29184]] for processing of personal data. Though the lawful basis for a consent record would always be consent, the presence of the field enables extensions of the record to other legal bases (e.g. contract) in the future. In DPV, the legal basis is associated using <code>hasLegalBasis</code> with a concept from the <code>LegalBasis</code> taxonomy.</p>
            <p>In addition to defining consent as a legal basis, DPV also provides a taxonomy to express various categories of consent - such as <code>InformedConsent</code> and <code>ExpressedConsent</code> which provide a more granular and accurate definition of the legal basis being utilised. For expressing specific consent based on specific jurisdictions and regulations, the appropriate extended concept should be used, for e.g. [[EU-GDPR]] extension defines consent as a legal basis based on the specific clauses and requirements of the [[GDPR]].</p>
            <aside class="example" title="Example specifying consent as a legal basis">
            <p>Consent is directly associated with the first <code>PersonalDataHandling</code> as the legal basis. Such use is commonly interpreted as meaning consent according to some obligations and requirements to be considered valid, for example being informed and expressed rather than assumed. The second <code>PersonalDataHandling</code> uses the specific type of consent required which clearly indicates which requirements it is expected to fulfil to be considered valid.</p>

        <p>To indicate that a GDPR-defined consent is being used as the legal basis, the [[EU-GDPR]] concept is used by itself or in combination with a core consent type to explicitly indicate the level of consent.

In [[ISO-29184]], this field is only limited to Recipients who are Third Parties, which excludes the Data Controllers and Processors. In DPV, recipients can be any of Data Controllers, or Processors, or Third Parties.</p>
        <p>Note that recipients can be specific entities i.e. their identity is known, or groups or categories of entities - for example as in GDPR's Article 13-1e. However, [[ISO-29184]] only considered explicitly indicated third parties for the recipients field.</p>
        <p>In [[ISO-29184]], the recipient field is also associated with information regarding the geo-location of data being transferred to the recipient third party's and whether this constitutes a jurisdictional change. To represent this in DPV, the location of the transfer should be indicated within the processing information along with the recipient entity. The jurisdiction can also be represented in the same context - to indicate the transfer to that jurisdiction, or it can be specified in association with the recipient entity.</p>

        <aside class="example" title="Example specifying rights exercise information">
            <p>Expressing rights exercise information using DPV is done using the <code>DataSubjectRight</code> instance and associated using <code>hasRight</code>.

            <p>To indicate specific rights under a particular jurisdiction or regulation, the appropriate concepts have to be declared and used. In this example, GDPR's Right to Withdraw Consent (Art.7-3) and Right to Data Portability (Art.20) are described with information on how to exercise them. This can be done with explicit acknowledgement of GDPR as the regulation using <code>dpv:hasApplicableLaw</code>, and EU as the jurisdiction using <code>hasJurisdiction</code>.</p>

            <p>To indicate what will be the resulting action from exercising the right, existing concepts and external vocabularies such as schema.org or DCAT can be used.

    <p>This field MUST be present.</p>
    <p>Indicates the <i>legal name</i> and <i>identity</i> of the Entity, expressed using <code>dpv:hasLegalName</code> and a string.</p>
    <aside class="example" title="Example specifying entity name">
            <pre><code>{

    <p>DPV provides a taxonomy of different entity types, such as organisations, which can also be used to indicate what the entity is. In this example, the entity is declared to be a non-profit organisation.</p>
    <pre><code>{

    <h4>Identifier</h4>
    <p>This field MUST be present.</p>
    <p>Indicates the <i>unique identifier</i> for the entity within the record. In linked data and semantic web methods of expressing information, the IRI already acts as an unique identifier. To support interoperability, the IRI identifier MUST be declared explicitly using <code>dpv:hasIdentifier</code>. To denote other (unique or otherwise) identifiers as a reference to the entity, <code>dct:identifier</code> should be used.</p>
    <p>In this specification and in [[ISO-29184]], the (IRI) identifier is used to associate the entity with specific processing roles, which is described in the next section.</p>
    <aside class="example" title="Example specifying entity identifier">
            <p>The IRI of the entity is an identifier through which it can be uniquely identified. In this example, the entity has an <code>id</code> field which specifies its unique identifier, which is explicitly declared also using <code>dpv:hasIdentifier</code> to enable interoperability when converting between formats and schemas.</p>
            <pre><code>{
    "@id": "https://example.com/a6f58318-72e6-46a2-bfd7-f36d795e30cd",
    "@type": "dpv:ConsentRecord",
    "dpv:hasEntity": {
        "@type": "dpv:Entity",
        "@id": "https://example.com/AcmeInc",
        "dpv:hasIdentifier": "https://example.com/AcmeInc"
    }
}</code></pre>
            <p>In this example, the entity has another identifier other than its IRI which should be considered as the unique identifier to identify this entity. It is therefore associated using <code>dpv:hasIdentifier</code> while the IRI is declared as an alternate identifier using <code>dct:identifier</code></p>
            <pre><code>{
    "@id": "https://example.com/a6f58318-72e6-46a2-bfd7-f36d795e30cd",
    "@type": "dpv:ConsentRecord",
    "dpv:hasEntity": {

        "dct:identifier": "https://example.com/AcmeInc"
    }
}</code></pre>
            <p>In this example, the entity's tax registration number is indicated as an additional identifier, with an explicit declaration of its meaning by using <a href="https://schema.org/PropertyValue"><code>schema:PropertyValue</code></a>. The example also shows the same information expressed using an appropriate domain specific ontology such as <a href="https://spec.edmcouncil.org/fibo/ontology/FND/Parties/Parties/TaxIdentifier"><code>fibo:TaxIdentifier</code></a> - as best practice.</p>
            <pre><code>{

    <h4>Role</h4>
    <p>This field MUST be present.</p>
    <p>Indicates the role of the entity within the process activities, indicated using <a href="http://purl.org/dc/terms/type">dct:type</a> and an appropriate role such as <code>dpv:DataController</code>, <code>dpv:DataProcessor</code>, <code>dpv:ThirdParty</code>, <code>dpv:Authority</code>, and <code>dpv:DataSubject</code>.</p>
    <p>In [[ISO-29184]], the entity (party) fields are separate from the processing section and therefore the role of the entity is expressed separate from processing. In DPV, the role MUST be expressed contextually within the processing fields by using an appropriate property e.g. <code>dpv:hasDataController</code> and the identifier of the entity. Optionally, the entity description field can also contain an explicit acknowledgement of the role by stating the entity is of type e.g. <code>dpv:DataController</code>.</p>
    <aside class="example" title="Example specifying entity role">
            <p>The role of the entity can be declared contextually using properties such as <code>dpv:hasDataController</code> and <code>dpv:hasDataSubject</code> within the processing section, and explicitly using <a href="http://purl.org/dc/terms/type">dct:type</a> within entity section. This example shows both uses for data controller and data subject entities. The (IRI) identifier of the entity is used within the processing section which points to the declared information within the entities section. The identifier for the data subject is a local identifier within the record and known to the data controller to minimise identifying information within the record.</p>

    <h4>Consent Type</h4>
    <p>This field MUST be present.</p>
    <p>Indicates the type of consent (e.g. Implicit, Expressed, Explicit) expressed by the data subject. In [[ISO-29184]], this field is called <i>event type</i>.</p>
    <p>In DPV, <code>dpv:ConsentType</code> represents consent types to be used as a legal basis (<code>dpv:hasLegalBasis</code>) and has the following different types:
        <code>dpv:InformedConsent</code> and <code>dpv:UninformedConsent</code> to indicate whether the consent is informed or not. Informed consent is further specialised as: <code>dpv:ImpliedConsent</code> for consent indicated through an implied or indirect action (e.g. merely browsing a website), <code>dpv:ExpressedConsent</code> for consent indicated through a direct expressed action (e.g. a checkbox), and <code>dpv:ExplicitlyExpressedConsent</code> for consent indicated through a direct action concerning solely the consent in context.</p>
    <p>Consent types are also dependent on jurisdictional requirements, such as GDPR's various consent types. These can be represented by expanding on the relevant DPV concepts. For GDPR, the following consent types are provided in [[EU-GDPR]]: <code>eu-gdpr:A6-1-a</code> expressed consent and <code>eu-gdpr:A9-2-a</code> explicit consent.</p>
    <p>Best practice for choosing appropriate consent types concern expressing the correct legal basis for a specific jurisdiction where possible (e.g. GDPR A.6-1a) or to indicate the type of consent (e.g. Expressed Consent) where the jurisdiction is explicitly provided or is understood from available context. Following this, the most appropriate consent types for most cases would be <code>dpv:ExpressedConsent</code> and <code>dpv:ExplicitlyExpressedConsent</code>.</p>
    <aside class="example" title="Example specifying consent types">
            <p>This example shows the consent type <code>dpv:ExplicitlyExpressedConsent</code> used as a legal basis. Since no jurisdiction is specified here, the interpretation of its validity depends on external context, or alternatively it indicates the interpretation of consent validity should be as per the interpretation of "explicitly expressed" in whatever jurisdiction is chosen.</p>
            <pre><code>{
    "@id": "https://example.com/a6f58318-72e6-46a2-bfd7-f36d795e30cd",
    "@type": "dpv:ConsentRecord",
    "dpv:hasProcess": {
        "@type": "dpv:Process",
        "dpv:hasLegalBasis": "dpv:ExplicitlyExpressedConsent"
    }
}</code></pre>
            <p>This example shows two uses of consent types both concerning <code>dpv:ExplicitlyExpressedConsent</code>. The first explicitly declares the jurisdiction as EU and the law being applicable as GDPR, and the second uses the GDPR clause Art.9-2a which indicates explicitly expressed consent. The advantage of the first approach is that the same consent type (explicitly expressed consent) can be used with different jurisdictions and laws, and the advantage of the second approach is in explicitly linking to a legal clause which is desirable for compliance evaluation and demonstration processes.</p>
            <pre><code>{

    <h4>Consent State</h4>
    <p>This field MUST be present.</p>
    <p>Indicate the <i>state</i> or <i>status</i> of consent reflecting its applicability or suitability to be used as a legal basis to justify the specified processing. In DPV, it is represented through <code>dpv:ConsentStatus</code> and associated using <code>dpv:hasConsentStatus</code>. Instances of consent states represent specific events concerning the use of consent as a legal basis, e.g. requesting consent, giving consent, withdrawing consent. Each event may have corresponding processes, such as giving consent enables the processing to take place and withdrawing consent stops the processing taking place.</p>
    <p>DPV provides several states broadly categorised under those valid for processing and those that are not. These are:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>The consent states that are considered valid for processing (<code>dpv:ConsentStatusValidForProcessing</code>) are: <code>dpv:ConsentGiven</code>, <code>dpv:RenewedConsentGiven</code>.</li>
        <li>The consent states that are NOT considered valid for processing (<code>dpv:ConsentStatusInvalidForProcessing</code>) are: <code>dpv:ConsentUnknown</code>, <code>dpv:ConsentRequested</code>, <code>dpv:ConsentRequestDeferred</code>, <code>dpv:ConsentRefused</code>, <code>dpv:ConsentWithdrawn</code>, <code>dpv:ConsentExpired</code>, <code>dpv:ConsentTerminated</code>, <code>dpv:ConsentInvalidated</code>.
    </ul>
    <aside class="example" title="Example specifying consent state">
            <p>This example specifies the association of consent states within the consent record. It shows that consent has been given for processing that had explicitly expressed consent as its legal basis. It can be inferred that the given consent is expected to be of type "explicitly expressed".

    <p>This field MUST be present.</p>
    <p>The time of the associated event (e.g. giving consent, withdrawing consent), indicated using <code>dpv:isIndicatedAtTime</code>. [[ISO-29184]] defines this field as the time the event was expressed or exercised by the specified entity (e.g. when data subject gave consent), and requires this field use a value as per [[ISO-8601]] UTC time to declare the timestamp associated with the event.</p>

    <h4>Event Duration</h4>
    <p>This field MUST be present.</p>
    <p>Indicates the duration or the condition for determining validity of the duration for the event. It is indicated using <code>dpv:Duration</code> and associated using <code>dpv:hasDuration</code>. DPV provides the following duration concepts: </p>
    <ul>
        <li><code>TemporalDuration</code> for indicating a relative temporal duration, e.g. 6 months from the indicated event date.</li>
        <li><code>UntilTimeDuration</code> for indicating duration that occurs until the end of specified time, e.g. until 31 DEC 2023.</li>
        <li><code>UntilEventDuration</code> for indicating duration that occurs until the end of specified event, e.g. until account is closed.</li>
        <li><code>FixedOccurrencesDuration</code> for a duration that is based on number of occurrences, e.g. using it 3 times</li>
        <li><code>EndlessDuration</code> for indicating a duration without an end condition or temporal notation. Note that endless duration is not considered best practice and is considered invalid in several jurisdictions.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>[[ISO-29184]] specifies that where the duration relates to the validity of given consent, the duration also indicates that the Data Controller should request the data subject to confirm or 'refresh' their consent without which the consent cannot be valid for processing.</p>
    <aside class="example" title="Example specifying consent state duration">

    <h4>Expression by Entity</h4>
    <p>This field MUST be present.</p>
    <p>Indicates which entity or agent (party in [[ISO-29184]]) exercised or expressed the specified event. For example, if it was the data subject or their guardian who expressed the given consent. In DPV, this is indicated using the appropriate <code>dpv:Entity</code> concept and associated using <code>dpv:isIndicatedBy</code>.</p>
    <p>In [[ISO-29184]], this field is called <i>entity id</i> and is used to link to the relevant entity through their identifier (e.g. data subject identifier or to an entry in the party section). As this field MUST be present in [[ISO-29184]], the most common value expected here will be a reference to the data subject. In DPV, this can also be indicated using <code>dpv:DataSubject</code> instead of the identifier.</p>

    <h3>Supporting GDPR and DGA</h3>
    <p><strong>Using ISO-29184 within the EU legal
    framework:</strong> ISO-29184 is developed and governed
    by the International Standards Organisation (ISO), and is not specific
    to EU’s regulations and terminology. To support its use in the legal
    frameworks, it needs to be approved as ‘Euronorm’ (EN) through an EU
    standardisation body such as CEN, CENELEC, or ESO. At the moment,
    ISO-29184 has already been approved as EN.</p>
    <p>Having standards as EN provides a strong framework for their
    utilisation in regulations, such as for notice and consent under GDPR.
    However, merely adopting the standards on an ‘as-is’ basis will not be
    sufficient. For example, the terminology in 29184 and GDPR has crucial
    differences which must be identified and appropriate guidance developed
    to enable using ISO-29184 with GDPR. Similarly, to address current
    issues regarding consent
    and further studies are required to assess the extent of these standards
    in solving existing issues and what additional measures need to be
    adopted beyond conformance with the standards.</p>
