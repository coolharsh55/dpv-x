    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <section>
    <h3>Consent Records and Receipts</h3>
    <p><i>(Given) Consent</i> is an important legal basis as it requires an affirmative action from data subjects or users that must fulfil certain conditions to be considered <i>Valid Consent</i>. Such requirements can be defined through regulations such as [[GDPR]] or through use of standards and codes of conduct. <i>Informed Consent</i> is one such requirement that requires information be provided, in the form of a <i>Consent Notice</i>, to inform the data subject about the processing that will occur based on the consent and to enable them to make an <i>informed choice or decision</i>.</p>
    
    <p>In order to assess whether an instance of given consent is valid thus requires keeping records of information regarding how the consent was obtained i.e. the notice, and how the consent is being utilised i.e. the processing enabled through that consent. This same information is also required for the organisation to determine whether its processing activities should continue, e.g. depending on whether a particular user has given consent, and where different systems require this information, e.g. different processes using their own technologies to store and check consent. Such information that is documented and maintained regarding consent is called a <i>Consent Record</i>.</p>

    <p>Where the information is to be communicated to another entity, it can be provided in the form of a <i>Consent Receipt</i>, which is an authoritative copy of the consent record - similar to how a shopping transaction invovles a merchant's copy and a <i>receipt</i> provided to the customer. While consent records have been maintained by organisations for some time now, the issuing of consent receipts is a relatively new activity.</p>

    <p>[[[ISO-27560]]] is a <a href="https://www.iso.org/deliverables-all.html#TS"><i>Technical Specification</i> (TS)</a> that "specifies an interoperable, open and extensible information structure" for recording the data subject's consent to processing of their personal data i.e. as consent records, and to provide this information i.e. as consent receipts. The specification lists <i>information fields</i> that represent specific information associated with consent, and requirements over the form this information can take e.g. format, number of values, and whether it is mandatory or optional to be present. A <i>[[ISO-27560]] conformant</i> implementation is one that fulfils all requirements by either storing information in the form prescribed by [[ISO-27560]], or by storing information in a form that can be converted or transformed to fulfil its requirements.</p>

    <p>[[ISO-27560]] allows for changes to made to the fields, for example to suit and match domain-specific labels or descriptions, or to introduce additional fields or information types that are needed. Such changes, expressed as <i>schemas</i> or <i>profiles</i>, are still required to be compatible with the requirements of [[ISO-27560]], such as by requiring the same fields to be mandatory. This document, referred to as [[DPV-27560]], is a schema or profile of [[ISO-27560]], and is intended to enable the use of [[DPV]] to represent information for the implementation of consent records and receipts.</p>

            <li>To introduce [[[ISO-27560]]] for [[[DPV]]] audiences.</li>
            <li>To provide a mapping of [[ISO-27560]] to [[DPV]] concepts.</li>

        <h3>Scope</h3>
        <p>The scope of this document is defined as follows:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>The implementation of [[DPV-27560]] is limited to information represented within a consent record, and the information on how a notice is provided or matching the contents of a notice to that of a consent record is outside the scope. Those interested in notices should refer to [[[DPV-29184]]].</li>
            <li>[[DPV-27560]], like [[ISO-27560]] and [[DPV]] is intended to be jurisdiction-agnostic. Use of specific jurisdictional concepts and requirements such as those provided in this document for [[GDPR]] require the use of appropriate DPV extensions such as [[DPV-GDPR]].</li>
            <li>[[DPV-27560]] is limited to the representation of information as defined by [[ISO-27560]]. The security, communication, and maintainence of this information is outside the scope of this document.</li>
            <li>[[DPV-27560]], like [[ISO-27560]], is intended to facilitate interoperability of information and to ensure the required information is available in a form that can be used for its verification of conformance and compliance. Information described using [[DPV-27560]] can be maintained in a compatible form by an organisation for purposes such as alignment with internal terminology, processes, and technologies. Describing such compatible implementations beyond the guidance provided is outside the scope of this document.</li>
        </ul>
    </section>

    <section id="terminology">
        <h3>Terminology</h3>
        <p>The terminology used in [[ISO-27560]], [[GDPR]], and [[DPV]] differ in <i>terms or labels</i> used, but largely represent the same <i>semantic concepts</i>. This guide uses the [[DPV]] terminology unless referring to specific fields or terms used in a particular document. To assist with understanding and applying the terminologies across these three sources, [[[#terms]]] provides a summary table mapping the terms.</p>

    <h2>Overview of Consent in DPV</h2>
    <p>The concepts <a href="https://w3id.org/dpv#ConsentRecord">`Consent Record`</a> and <a href="https://w3id.org/dpv#ConsentReceipt">`Consent Receipt`</a> are defined in [[DPV]] as <a href="https://w3id.org/dpv#OrganisationalMeasure">`Organisational Measures`</a> to indicate using these as a 'good practice' to safeguard processing of personal data following the principles of transparency and accountability.</p>
    <div class="issue" title="How to express ConsentRecord and associate it?">
        <p>If Consent Records are a type of `OrganisationalMeasure`, then they can be associated using `hasOrganisationalMeasure`. Should more granular relations of `hasConsentRecord` and `hasConsentReceipt` be defined? Or should abstract relations `hasProcessingRecord` and `hasReceipt` be defined to also be reusable for other records (e.g. ROPA) and receipts (e.g. rights exercise receipts)?</p>
    </div>
    <p><a href="https://w3id.org/dpv#Consent">`Consent`</a> is a category of <a href="https://w3id.org/dpv#LegalBasis">`Legal Basis`</a> in [[DPV]], with specialised concepts extending it to describe types of consent, such as <a href="https://w3id.org/dpv#ExpressedConsent">`Expressed Consent`</a> and <a href="https://w3id.org/dpv#ExplicitlyExpressedConsent">`Explicitly Expressed Consent`</a>. To associate consent as a legal basis, the relation <a href="https://w3id.org/dpv#hasLegalBasis">`has Legal Basis`</a> is used with the appropriate consent concept.</p>
    <p><a href="https://w3id.org/dpv#ConsentStatus">`Consent Status`</a> represents information regarding the stage at which the process of obtaining, using, and maintaining consent is currently at. DPV provides categories of statuses based on practical requirements, for example - <a href="https://w3id.org/dpv#ConsentRequested">`Consent Requested`</a>, <a href="https://w3id.org/dpv#ConsentGiven">`Consent Given`</a>, and <a href="https://w3id.org/dpv#ConsentWithdrawn">`Consent Withdrawn`</a>. To indicate the status of consent, the relation <a href="https://w3id.org/dpv#hasConsentStatus">`has Consent Status`</a> is used with the appropriate consent status concept.</p>
    <p>To express how consent or an action associated with consent was indicated (or given or obtained), the relation <a href="https://w3id.org/dpv#hasIndicationMethod">`has Indication Method`</a> is used. To express the time, the relation <a href="https://w3id.org/dpv#isIndicationTime">`is Indication Time`</a> is used. To express the entity expressing the action, the relation <a href="https://w3id.org/dpv#isIndicatedBy">`is Indicated By`</a> is used.</p>
    <p>To indicate details about the consent, such as which data subject it is about, or the processing activities and entities associated with it, the relevant concepts and relations are to be reused. For example, <a href="https://w3id.org/dpv#hasDataSubject">`has Data Subject`</a> relation with <a href="https://w3id.org/dpv#DataSubject">`Data Subject`</a> concept indicates the data subject or individual who is the subject of the consent. Similarly, <a href="https://w3id.org/dpv#hasPurpose">`has Purpose`</a> with <a href="https://w3id.org/dpv#Purpose">`Purpose`</a> indicates the purpose of processing personal data, and <a href="https://w3id.org/dpv#hasDataController">`has Data Controller`</a> with <a href="https://w3id.org/dpv#DataController">`Data Controller`</a> indicates the entity responsible for the processing. Further information on the concepts and relations relevant to [[ISO-27560]] is summarised in [[[#terms]]], and is provided in [[DPV]] specification.</p>

<section id="27560-overview">
    <h2>Overview of 27560</h2>

    <h3>Goals &amp; Scope</h3>
    <p>[[[ISO-27560]]] has two broad goals: to guide the recording of information about consent for processing of personal data in a form that is interoperable, open, and extendable, and to provide information to individuals. To supplement this, it defines several requirements (as <i>controls</i> in ISO terminology) for ensuring the required information is maintained and is supported by appropriate processes within the organisation. [[ISO-27560]] is stated as a supplement to the earlier [[[ISO-29184]]], where [[ISO-29184]] defines how information is provided via notices in order to request consent, and [[ISO-27560]] defines how information is recorded for given consent and provided back to the individual (as receipts).</p>
    <p>The objective of [[ISO-27560]] is to define an information structure for consent record which contains information about: (1) Personal data associated with processing activities; (2) Notices describing the processing activities; (3) Sources of data with methods and timestamps for how it was obtained; and (4) When consent was given. It also defines the information structure for the optional provision of this information or a reference to this information - to the data subject in the form of a consent receipt.</p>
    <p>Specific implementations and considerations are defined to be out of scope and as 'implementation details'. Annexes in [[ISO-27560]] provide informative guidance on: Performance and efficiency considerations (Annex C), Format and encoding structures (Annex D), Security of records and receipts (Annex E), and application in PIMS or privacy information management systems (Annex G). Further uses of consent records or receipts, such as how data subjects can obtain consent receipts or maintain their own consent records - it not within the scope of [[ISO-27560]].</p>

    <h3>Structure</h3>
    <p>Most of [[ISO-27560]] describes the information and fields in a <i>Consent Record</i>, which are reused in the section for <i>Consent Receipt</i>. A Consent Record contains four sections as described below and depicted visually in the figure:</p>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Header:</strong> metadata about the record e.g. its unique identifier and timestamp of creation.</li>
        <li><strong>Processing:</strong> information about the processing activities e.g. purposes, personal data.</li>
        <li><strong>Parties:</strong> information about entities involved in the processing e.g. controllers.</li>
        <li><strong>Events:</strong> information about <i>consent events</i> e.g. consent given, consent withdrawn.</li>
    </ol>
    <figure>
        <img src="dpv-27560-summary.png">
        <figcaption>Summary of fields in ISO/IEC TS 27560:2023. The field names have been modified for alignment with DPV concepts. Field names in bold are required to be present.</figcaption>
    </figure>
    <p>Each section contains fields which describe the information that must be represented along with the form (e.g. timestamp format) and its necessity (e.g. required or optional). Certain fields are expressed as references to other fields (e.g. controller in Processing is a reference to a value in Parties).</p>

    <!-- <h3>Header section</h3> -->

    <!-- <h3>Processing section</h3> -->

    <!-- <h3>Parties section</h3> -->

    <!-- <h3>Events section</h3> -->

    <h3>Consent Receipt</h3>
    <p>The Consent Receipt in [[ISO-27560]] contains only two required fields representing a unique identifier for the receipt and the schema version used for the structuring of information. The information and contents are undefined and left to each implementor to specify. A receipt can optionally contain the entirety of the information within a consent record or can also multiple records or contain other information not within a record. Alternatively, a receipt can contain references to information within a record without containing the information itself e.g. as the consent record identifier.</p>

    <h2>Mapping 27560 to DPV and GDPR</h2>
    <p>The table below provides a comparison between the terms and concepts used in [[ISO-27560]], [[GDPR]], and [[DPV]]. It is neither exhaustive nor authoritative, and is provided as an informative resource to better understand and apply the concepts as they are expressed in the two normative documents ([[ISO-27560]] and [[GDPR]]). The column <i>req.?</i> reflects whether maintaining information on the concept is mandatory or optional. Where the value of this is expressed as a dash (<tt>-</tt>) it means <i>not applicable</i> to reflect the concept is not present or is covered by another term in the table. Note that for GDPR, the table only reflects the information to be maintained - either directly associated with the consent or elsewhere, and does not cover any specific requirements such as the validity of consent as per Art.4-11 or application of principles in Art.6.</p>

    <h2>DPV-27560 Consent Record</h2>
    <p>The IRI `https://w3id.org/dpv/schema/iso-27560` defines the [[DPV-27560]] as a schema or profile for [[ISO-27560]].</p>
    <div class="note" title="DPV's modelling of information as graphs and absence of 27560 'sections'">
        <p>Due to way DPV is utilised and expressed (e.g. RDF graph, JSON) - there is no necessity to replicate the four sections of [[ISO-27560]] as information is linked and expressed as a single graph. Therefore, the DPV implementation ignores the structuring into sections.</p>
    </div>

    <p class="issue" title="Table mapping 27560 header fields to DPV"></p>
    <p>Information representing the metadata in the header field containing information about the record:</p>
        <h4>Schema Version</h4>
            <p>This field <strong>MUST</strong> be present.</p>

        <h3>Notice Fields</h3>
        <p>These fields refer to information about the notice that has been shown to request consent. In [[ISO-27560]], these fields are part of the Processing section.</p>

        <h4>Notice</h4>
        <p>This field <strong>MUST</strong> be present.</p>
        <p>Reference to the specific version of the notice (`privacy_notice` in [[ISO-27560]]) associated with consent, indicated using `dpv:hasNotice` and a reference to the notice or an instance of `dpv:ConsentNotice`. If there are multiple notices - then each must be indicated separately. Multiple notices can be associated where such notices are part of the same context e.g. shown one after the other, or where they are associated over time, e.g. one notice shown initially when requesting and another when re-confirming it at a later time.</p>
        <div class="note" title="Distinction between Privacy Notice and Consent Notice">
            <p>In DPV, the concepts `dpv:PrivacyNotice` and `dpv:ConsentNotice` have different intended meanings - a consent notice is a specific privacy notice associated with consent, most commonly providing information in order to request consent. Whereas, a privacy notice can also refer to other documents providing information, such as what is commonly called as 'privacy policy'. For the purposes of the consent record, both documents can be included, but `dpv:ConsentNotice` MUST be used when referring to the notice used for providing information for consent.</p>

    <h3>Processing Fields</h3> 
    <p>[[ISO-27560]] contains 22 fields related to processing activities, and 5 additional fields regarding personal data involved in processing. The structuring of these fields within [[ISO-27560]] is of the form where the "PII Processing" section contains an array of "purposes" where each "purpose" is expressed with its own fields regarding legal basis, collection method, storage locations, and so on. Within the DPV implementation, this is replaced with <code>dpv:PersonalDataHandling</code> so that each instance represents a distinct processing activity with its fields e.g. purposes, personal data, recipients.</p>

        <h4>Personal Data Handling</h4>
        <p>This field <strong>MUST</strong> be present.</p>
        <p>`dpv:PersonalDataHandling` is a concept that represents a process or 'unit' for combining relevant details such as purposes, processing, personal data categories, recipients, and so on. Instances of `dpv:PersonalDataHandling` can be used to differentiate between information regarding processing - such as where different purposes are used or that lead to different recipients. Such instances can also be nested within other instances to create a 'modular' structuring of processing activities.</p>
        <div class="note" title="Benefits of using `dpv:PersonalDataHandling`">
            <p>Following the [[ISO-27560]] model requires creating a concept called 'purposes' and to utilise an array or a list to hold the associated 'purpose' instances. Given that DPV prefers a strict taxonomy expressed in a graph representation, following the same model would lead to non-intuitive structures. Further, other similar lists such as those for 'pii_type' also require creation of new concepts to represent groups or collections of the actual intended concepts.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="issue" title="Create Process as a subtype of PersonalDataHandling">
            <p>The term 'Personal Data Handling' is non-intuitive and difficult to grasp. By contrast, the term 'Process' is commonly used and is intuitive. Therefore, a new concept called `Process` should be added, and for backwards compatibility be declared as a subtype of `PersonalDataHandling`. The existing relations benefit from this by use of phrasing such as "personal data associated with a process".</p>
        </div>
        <aside class="example" title="Example using Personal Data Handling">
                <p>A single instance of Personal Data Handling:</p>

            <p>[[ISO-27560]] has an additional field called 'purpose_type' that describes the category of the purpose. In DPV, this is declared by using concepts from the purpose along with `rdf:type`. For additional information, such as descriptions, relevant DCT relations should be used.</p>
            <div class="note" title="Interpreting multiple purposes within a single context">
                <p>Where multiple purposes are present within the same or single context, for example the consent record or a personal data handling instance, the interpretation is that they are all applicable for that context. For example, if a personal data handling instance contains 3 purposes - then it is presumed that the consent is for carrying out each of the 3 purposes.</p>
                <p>To declare that ALL purposes must occur together i.e. they cannot be carried out independently, the appropriate semantic relations should be used to express this information - for e.g. by declaring the 3 required purposes as the 'type' for a new combined purpose.</p>
                <p>Caution is advised when modelling consent as jurisdictional requirements such as those from GDPR e.g. Recital 32 states "Consent should cover all processing activities carried out for the same purpose or purposes. When the processing has multiple purposes, consent should be given for all of them.". This means all purposes listed within a record pertaining to a single consent are to be used with that single consent as the legal basis.</p>

                <p>Necessity (or Optionality) can also be expressed at broader contexts, such as for the entire personal data handling instance. This has the advantage over [[ISO-27560]] in that some purpose or processing could also be stated to be necessary or optional. In such cases, the expressed necessity is to be applied to ALL concepts within that instance. In the below example, the first instance has both purpose (communication) and personal data (email) as required or necessary, and the second has both (marketing, name) as optional.</p>
                <pre><code>{

        <h5>Geographic Restriction(s)</h5>
        <p>This field MAY be present.</p>
        <p>Geographic restrictions are defined in [[ISO-27560]] as restrictions related to geo-locations or jurisdictions. While DPV prefers a declarative interpretation where, for e.g., if processing location is mentioned as EU then it implies that processing will only take place within EU since no other locations are mentioned. If the intention is to explicitly state this as a restriction, it can utilise the <code>dpv:Rule</code> concept which provides (simplified) Permissions, Prohibitions, and Obligations. For further expressivity or complexity, specifications such as [[[odrl-model]]] should be considered.</p>
        <p>Note that while [[ISO-27560]] only considers restrictions over geographic locations for processing (including storing), DPV (and ODRL)support specifying information and restrictions over a much wider range of concepts. In theory, restrictions can be expressed over any concept or combination of concepts.</p>
        <aside class="example" title="Example specifying geographic restrictions on the processing of personal data">
            <p>The below example expresses that data must be stored within EU. Note that DPV's concepts do not support expressing negations i.e. we cannot state data must <i>not</i> be stored within <i>non-EU</i> locations. Also note the ambiguity in interpreting DPV's obligation as meaning either data must only be stored in EU or must at least be stored in EU (in addition to elsewhere). An alternative to this is to utilise an appropriate vocabulary such as [[ODRL]] - as in the second rule below, or as a last resort to use plain text - which is less desirable.</p>

        <h4>Data Controller(s)</h4>
        <p>This field <strong>MUST</strong> be present.</p>
        <p>Indicates the Data Controllers (pii controllers in [[ISO-27560]]) responsible for the specified processing activities, expressed in DPV  using <code>hasDataController</code> with instances of <code>DataController</code>.</p>
        <p>Note that the notion of a 'Controller' is regarding accountability, and does not necessarily correlate with who performs the processing or has access to data - for example in GDPR. To indicate who performs the processing, DPV provides <code>dpv:isImplementedByEntity</code>.</p>
        <p>Information about the Data Controller, such as its name or address, is described through the <i>Entity Fields</i> later in the document based on a similar structure in [[ISO-27560]].</p>
        <aside class="example" title="Example specifying Data Controllers">
            <p>The below examples show processing where a single entity acts as the data controller for all of the processing (represented using <code>PersonalDataHandling</code>, and extends it to show how  different controllers can be associated for different processing activities.</p>
            <pre><code>{

        <h4>Legal Basis</h4>
            <p>This field MAY be present.</p>
            <p>The legal basis (lawful basis in [[ISO-27560]] for processing of personal data. Though the lawful basis for a consent record would always be consent, the presence of the field enables extensions of the record to other legal bases (e.g. contract) in the future. In DPV, the legal basis is associated using <code>hasLegalBasis</code> with a concept from the <code>LegalBasis</code> taxonomy.</p>
            <p>In addition to defining consent as a legal basis, DPV also provides a taxonomy to express various categories of consent - such as <code>InformedConsent</code> and <code>ExpressedConsent</code> which provide a more granular and accurate definition of the legal basis being utilised. For expressing specific consent based on specific jurisdictions and regulations, the appropriate extended concept should be used, for e.g. [[DPV-GDPR]] defines consent as a legal basis based on the specific clauses and requirements of the [[GDPR]].</p>
            <aside class="example" title="Example specifying consent as a legal basis">
            <p>Consent is directly associated with the first <code>PersonalDataHandling</code> as the legal basis. Such use is commonly interpreted as meaning consent according to some obligations and requirements to be considered valid, for example being informed and expressed rather than assumed. The second <code>PersonalDataHandling</code> uses the specific type of consent required which clearly indicates which requirements it is expected to fulfil to be considered valid.</p>
            <pre><code>{
    "@id": "https://example.com/a6f58318-72e6-46a2-bfd7-f36d795e30cd",
    "@type": "dpv:ConsentRecord",
    "dpv:hasPersonalDataHandling": [{
        "@type": "dpv:PersonalDataHandling",
        "dpv:hasLegalBasis": "dpv:Consent"
    }, {
        "@type": "dpv:PersonalDataHandling",
        "dpv:hasLegalBasis": "dpv:ExplicitlyExpressedConsent"
    }]
}</code></pre>
        <p>To indicate that a GDPR-defined consent is being used as the legal basis, the [[DPV-GDPR]] concept is used by itself or in combination with a core consent type to explicitly indicate the level of consent. Note that in the second example, [[DPV-GDPR]] already defines <code>A9-2-a</code> as a subtype of <code>dpv:ExplicitlyExpressedConsent</code>, so the combined use does not lead to contradictions.</p>
        <pre><code>{
    "@id": "https://example.com/a6f58318-72e6-46a2-bfd7-f36d795e30cd",
    "@type": "dpv:ConsentRecord",

</aside>
        
        <h4>Recipients</h4>
        <p>This field <strong>MUST</strong> be present.</p>
        <p>Indicates the recipients of personal data associated with the specific processing activities, expressed as <code>dpv:Recipient</code> and associated using <code>dpv:hasRecipient</code>. In [[ISO-27560]], this field is only limited to Recipients who are Third Parties, which excludes the Data Controllers and Processors. In DPV, recipients can be any of Data Controllers, or Processors, or Third Parties.</p>
        <p>Note that recipients can be specific entities i.e. their identity is known, or groups or categories of entities - for example as in GDPR's Article 13-1e. However, [[ISO-27560]] only considered explicitly indicated third parties for the recipients field.</p>
        <p>In [[ISO-27560]], the recipient field is also associated with information regarding the geo-location of data being transferred to the recipient third party's and whether this constitutes a jurisdictional change. To represent this in DPV, the location of the transfer should be indicated within the processing information along with the recipient entity. The jurisdiction can also be represented in the same context - to indicate the transfer to that jurisdiction, or it can be specified in association with the recipient entity.</p>
        <aside class="example" title="Example specifying recipients of personal data">
            <p>Recipients can be indicated separately for the entirety of <code>PersonalDataHandling</code> which indicates all data is being received by the specified recipient.</p>
            <pre><code>{
    "@id": "https://example.com/a6f58318-72e6-46a2-bfd7-f36d795e30cd",
    "@type": "dpv:ConsentRecord",
    "dpv:hasPersonalDataHandling": {
        "@type": "dpv:PersonalDataHandling",
        "dpv:hasPersonalData": ["dpv-pd:Email", "dpv-pd:Name"],
        "dpv:hasDataController": "ex:Acme",
        "dpv:hasRecipient": "ex:Beta"
    }
}</code></pre>
            <p>Recipients can be also be indicated contextually within each <code>PersonalDataHandling</code> or <code>Processing</code> to indicate the recipient entity for that specific context - which allows to separate the recipients based on what data and processing they are associated with. In the below example, the first activity has Acme receiving the Email, and the second activity has Beta collecting the Name and transferring it to Gamma.</p>
            <pre><code>{
    "@id": "https://example.com/a6f58318-72e6-46a2-bfd7-f36d795e30cd",
    "@type": "dpv:ConsentRecord",

        "dpv:hasPersonalData": "dpv-pd:Email",
        "dpv:hasRecipient": "ex:Acme"
    }, {
        "@type": "dpv:PersonalDataHandling",
        "dpv:hasPersonalData": "dpv-pd:Name",
        "dpv:hasProcessing": [{
            "@type": "dpv:Collect",

            "dpv:hasRecipient": "ex:Gamma"
        }
    }
}</code></pre>
            <p>To specify the locations and jurisdictions of recipients, the appropriate DPV concepts and relations are used. In the below example, the first activity states Acme is a Recipient and also the Data Controller whose location is Ireland, and the second activity states that the transfer to Beta has location France and jurisdiction EU.</p>
            <pre><code>{

    <li>record is personal data - information within a consent record and the record itself also constitutes personal data, therefore appropriate measures are required to safeguard it</li>
    <li>identification for record/receipt - each consent must be attributed to the data subject it is about, however this does not mean records and receipts require additional identification procedures to get this information. Where no identity or identifier is available, a new identifier should be created for the purposes of record/receipt only e.g. visitors to the website</li>
    <li>integrity of contents - mechanisms such as using cryptographic hashes to provide integrity checks for information, ensuring storage retains accuracy of information, and any changes to structure of information should be assessed to ensure interpretation of contents of records/receipts is not changed</li>
    <li>verification of contents - disputes on changes in contents and discrepancies between records or receipts held by two or more entities are possible; mechanisms to cryptopgraphically 'sign' the information using verifiable means can assist in preventing such issues.

    <h3>Lifecycle of Consent</h3>
    <p>Processing of personal data utilises <i>Consent</i> as one of the possible legal bases. In the current regulatory environment, such consent has to be <i>valid</i> according to several criterion such as <i>being informed</i>, <i>freely given</i>, and <i>being unambiguous</i>. For consent to be informed, the data subject must have been provided or be aware of relevant information regarding the processing of personal data, typically through a <i>Consent Notice</i>, which describes the effect of their decision i.e. if consent is given which processing activities will take place, over which data, and who is involved in terms of entities. Other criterion, such as freely given and being unambiguous is determined through the manner in which this information is presented to request consent and how that consent is expressed.</p>
    <p>Once a consent has been given by the individual, they may also have the ability to regulate its use by withdrawing it at a later time. Such termination of consent results in the halting of its associated processing activities. Other causes of termination can be the expiry of duration for which the consent would be considered valid, termination by the Controller, or the consent being declared invalid by an authority such as the court.</p>
    <p>Based on these, a lifecycle can be charted regarding the various states that 'consent' can be stated to be in, which is essential to understand which states can be considered 'valid' for the processing of personal data. In the diagram below, consent states begin with a notice being shown to inform the individual and request their consent. Following this, the individual may make the decision to give or grant their consent, or to refuse it. If consent has been given, it can be re-confirmed or re-affirmed to assert its validity, or it can be terminated for several reasons such as its withdrawal by the individual. In all these, only when consent continues to be in a 'given' state can it be used to justify processing.</p>

    </figure>

    <p>Therefore, when creating records of consent - such as to demonstrate compliance, it is essential to not only have information regarding the processing activities governed by that consent, but to also have information which relates to determination of it being valid at a given time. This includes how the notice was provided, the <i>type</i> of consent that was expressed, and to associate these with relevant regulatory requirements that dictate the requirements for validity. In addition, changes to consent must also be recorded, whether they relate to an update to information resulting in a new notice, or the confirmation of an existing consent, or the termination of consent for reasons such as being withdrawn.</p>
    
    <h3>Consent Records</h3>
    <p>[[[ISO-27560]]] defines <i>Consent Record</i> as the documentation of information about a data subject's consent for the processing of their personal data in terms of the details about the processing as well as the interactions related to consent (e.g. giving or withdrawing it). Consent Records are an essential part of keeping records regarding whether consent has been obtained and is valid for processing, and to keep this information for correctly conducting processing relying on it. [[ISO-27560]] as well as regulatory requirements such as [[GDPR]] Article 7-1 require maintaining consent records where consent is used as the legal basis. While GDPR Article 7-1 only states that consent should be demonstrable, [[ISO-27560]] provides an information structure for how this information should be maintained and what processes should exist within an organisation in connection with it.</p>
    <p>It is important to distinguish between a <i>Consent Record</i> with several relevant but distinct concepts. A consent record only refers to the information recorded regarding consent, whereas a <i>Consent Notice</i> refers to the notice and information provided to the data subject in order to inform them about the processing - such as while requesting consent. While there is a significant overlap between a consent record and a consent notice, there are key differences such as notices orienting information for human consumption (e.g. layering of dialogues to provide summaries and detailed descriptions) and dictating the manner in which consent is expressed (e.g. checkboxes for options and confirmation by clicking a button). In contrast, a consent record is not required to accurately reflect the manner in which this information was presented to the user, but to only record it in a manner that enables assessing whether the consent is given and if so for which processing activities.</p>
    <p>This distinction is evident in [[[ISO-29184]]] being the standard for consent notices - which specifies what information should be present in a notice and the manner in which it is presented. In turn, [[ISO-27560]] only refers to notices to limit its scope to representing information necessary within a consent record. Therefore a consent record, despite containing a link to the notice, is not by itself sufficient to determine the <i>validity</i> of consent, and instead acts as the primary record containing information or links to information for conducting such assessments. Its primary purpose is therefore limited to provide an indication of the state of consent (e.g. request, given, terminated) for specific processing activities (e.g. which purpose, what recipients) and to document where additional information can be found on specific matters such as the notice shown when requesting consent.</p>
    <p>A [[ISO-27560]] conformant consent record typically has the following sections representing relevant information:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>metadata about the consent record such as its identifier</li>
        <li>the individual associated with the consent i.e. data subject</li>
        <li>the subject of consent i.e. specifics of the processing of personal data</li>
        <li>entities involved e.g. data controller and third parties</li>
        <li>relevant contextual information e.g. notice, rights, restrictions</li>
        <li>provenance of events associated with the consent e.g. given, withdrawn</li>
    </ol>
    <p>Under GDPR, the obligation to maintain records of consent is explicitly stated in Article 7-1 and Recital 42. This information includes, at a minimum, the identity of the Controller and the purposes of processing (Recital 42). Further Articles 13 and 14 dictate the information that must be provided to the data subject which includes recipients, transfers to third countries, data storage periods and conditions, existence of rights (including consent withdrawal), and specific information regarding processing such as the use of automated decision making or profiling.</p>

    <h3>Consent Receipts</h3>
    <p>[[ISO-27560]] defines a consent receipt as an authoritative document that is used to communicate the existence of a consent record or to provide information contained within it. It is effectively an 'authoritative copy' of a consent record provided by one entity to another, where it may contain all, some, or no information from the consent record regarding the consent and its relevance to processing activities. Such receipts may be useful to communicate the existence of consent decisions, or enable entities to exercise of rights or raise issues and complaint regarding processing activities.</p>
    <p>Consent receipts are a relatively newer and under-utilised practice, with no legal requirements existing that refer to the concept (or receipts) or state how they should be used. [[ISO-27560]] follows this by leaving it up to the organisations to decide how they want to implement receipts and what information is be provided through it. It defines a minimal structure consisting of some fields representing the receipt metadata, but does not have any requirements on the information within the receipt or its correspondence to fields within the record.</p>
    <p>A [[ISO-27560]] conformant consent receipt only requires a metadata section providing information about the consent receipt such as its identifier. Deciding on which additional information is to be provided and in what forms and using which structures is left up to implementing entities. In this guide, we presume that the consent receipt is intended for providing a copy of all information within the consent record.</p>
    <div class="note" title="Can only Controllers maintain Consent Records and provide Consent Receipts?">
        <p>According to [[ISO-27560]], records are generated and maintained by organisations (Controller, Third Party), and are utilised to provide receipts to a Data Subject. In contrast, the Kantara Consent Receipts specification [ref], upon which [[ISO-27560]] is based, defines Consent Receipts as being provided by a Data Subject to a Controller.</p>
        <p>For this document and the general use of DPV, we make no presumptions or enact restrictions on the use of records and receipts. Any entity, be it a Controller or a Data Subject, can maintain their own consent record or issue receipts. Though the phrasing of some sections may imply the Controller as the implementing entity, it does not preclude another entity from also implementing [[[ISO-27560]]].<p>
