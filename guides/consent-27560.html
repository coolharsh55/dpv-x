        <p>The ISO/IEC TS 27560:2023 Privacy technologies â€” Consent record information structure provides guidance on the creation of information records for representing information about consent. It also provides guidance on the use of this information in the form of 'receipts' that can be provided to assert the information in records. This document is a guide for the implementation of ISO/IEC TS 27560:2023 by using the Data Privacy Vocabulary (DPV) to represent information. Additionally, this document also provides guidance on using ISO/IEC TS 27560:2023 for meeting GDPR requirements regarding consent records.</p>

<h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>Introduction - what is a consent record, what is a consent receipt, when are they needed. What is 27560. What is DPV. What does this document provide. What is the scope.</p>
    <!-- <h3>Lifecycle of Consent</h3>
    <p>Processing of personal data utilises <i>Consent</i> as one of the possible legal bases. In the current regulatory environment, such consent has to be <i>valid</i> according to several criterion such as <i>being informed</i>, <i>freely given</i>, and <i>being unambiguous</i>. For consent to be informed, the data subject must have been provided or be aware of relevant information regarding the processing of personal data, typically through a <i>Consent Notice</i>, which describes the effect of their decision i.e. if consent is given which processing activities will take place, over which data, and who is involved in terms of entities. Other criterion, such as freely given and being unambiguous is determined through the manner in which this information is presented to request consent and how that consent is expressed.</p>
    <p>Once a consent has been given by the individual, they may also have the ability to regulate its use by withdrawing it at a later time. Such termination of consent results in the halting of its associated processing activities. Other causes of termination can be the expiry of duration for which the consent would be considered valid, termination by the Controller, or the consent being declared invalid by an authority such as the court.</p>
    <p>Based on these, a lifecycle can be charted regarding the various states that 'consent' can be stated to be in, which is essential to understand which states can be considered 'valid' for the processing of personal data. In the diagram below, consent states begin with a notice being shown to inform the individual and request their consent. Following this, the individual may make the decision to give or grant their consent, or to refuse it. If consent has been given, it can be re-confirmed or re-affirmed to assert its validity, or it can be terminated for several reasons such as its withdrawal by the individual. In all these, only when consent continues to be in a 'given' state can it be used to justify processing.</p>

    </figure>

    <p>Therefore, when creating records of consent - such as to demonstrate compliance, it is essential to not only have information regarding the processing activities governed by that consent, but to also have information which relates to determination of it being valid at a given time. This includes how the notice was provided, the <i>type</i> of consent that was expressed, and to associate these with relevant regulatory requirements that dictate the requirements for validity. In addition, changes to consent must also be recorded, whether they relate to an update to information resulting in a new notice, or the confirmation of an existing consent, or the termination of consent for reasons such as being withdrawn.</p>
    
    <h3>Consent Records</h3>
    <p>[[[ISO-27560]]] defines <i>Consent Record</i> as the documentation of information about a data subject's consent for the processing of their personal data in terms of the details about the processing as well as the interactions related to consent (e.g. giving or withdrawing it). Consent Records are an essential part of keeping records regarding whether consent has been obtained and is valid for processing, and to keep this information for correctly conducting processing relying on it. [[ISO-27560]] as well as regulatory requirements such as [[GDPR]] Article 7-1 require maintaining consent records where consent is used as the legal basis. While GDPR Article 7-1 only states that consent should be demonstrable, [[ISO-27560]] provides an information structure for how this information should be maintained and what processes should exist within an organisation in connection with it.</p>
    <p>It is important to distinguish between a <i>Consent Record</i> with several relevant but distinct concepts. A consent record only refers to the information recorded regarding consent, whereas a <i>Consent Notice</i> refers to the notice and information provided to the data subject in order to inform them about the processing - such as while requesting consent. While there is a significant overlap between a consent record and a consent notice, there are key differences such as notices orienting information for human consumption (e.g. layering of dialogues to provide summaries and detailed descriptions) and dictating the manner in which consent is expressed (e.g. checkboxes for options and confirmation by clicking a button). In contrast, a consent record is not required to accurately reflect the manner in which this information was presented to the user, but to only record it in a manner that enables assessing whether the consent is given and if so for which processing activities.</p>
    <p>This distinction is evident in [[[ISO-29184]]] being the standard for consent notices - which specifies what information should be present in a notice and the manner in which it is presented. In turn, [[ISO-27560]] only refers to notices to limit its scope to representing information necessary within a consent record. Therefore a consent record, despite containing a link to the notice, is not by itself sufficient to determine the <i>validity</i> of consent, and instead acts as the primary record containing information or links to information for conducting such assessments. Its primary purpose is therefore limited to provide an indication of the state of consent (e.g. request, given, terminated) for specific processing activities (e.g. which purpose, what recipients) and to document where additional information can be found on specific matters such as the notice shown when requesting consent.</p>
    <p>A [[ISO-27560]] conformant consent record typically has the following sections representing relevant information:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>metadata about the consent record such as its identifier</li>
        <li>the individual associated with the consent i.e. data subject</li>
        <li>the subject of consent i.e. specifics of the processing of personal data</li>
        <li>entities involved e.g. data controller and third parties</li>
        <li>relevant contextual information e.g. notice, rights, restrictions</li>
        <li>provenance of events associated with the consent e.g. given, withdrawn</li>
    </ol>
    <p>Under GDPR, the obligation to maintain records of consent is explicitly stated in Article 7-1 and Recital 42. This information includes, at a minimum, the identity of the Controller and the purposes of processing (Recital 42). Further Articles 13 and 14 dictate the information that must be provided to the data subject which includes recipients, transfers to third countries, data storage periods and conditions, existence of rights (including consent withdrawal), and specific information regarding processing such as the use of automated decision making or profiling.</p>

    <h3>Consent Receipts</h3>
    <p>[[ISO-27560]] defines a consent receipt as an authoritative document that is used to communicate the existence of a consent record or to provide information contained within it. It is effectively an 'authoritative copy' of a consent record provided by one entity to another, where it may contain all, some, or no information from the consent record regarding the consent and its relevance to processing activities. Such receipts may be useful to communicate the existence of consent decisions, or enable entities to exercise of rights or raise issues and complaint regarding processing activities.</p>
    <p>Consent receipts are a relatively newer and under-utilised practice, with no legal requirements existing that refer to the concept (or receipts) or state how they should be used. [[ISO-27560]] follows this by leaving it up to the organisations to decide how they want to implement receipts and what information is be provided through it. It defines a minimal structure consisting of some fields representing the receipt metadata, but does not have any requirements on the information within the receipt or its correspondence to fields within the record.</p>
    <p>A [[ISO-27560]] conformant consent receipt only requires a metadata section providing information about the consent receipt such as its identifier. Deciding on which additional information is to be provided and in what forms and using which structures is left up to implementing entities. In this guide, we presume that the consent receipt is intended for providing a copy of all information within the consent record.</p>
    <div class="note" title="Can only Controllers maintain Consent Records and provide Consent Receipts?">
        <p>According to [[ISO-27560]], records are generated and maintained by organisations (Controller, Third Party), and are utilised to provide receipts to a Data Subject. In contrast, the Kantara Consent Receipts specification [ref], upon which [[ISO-27560]] is based, defines Consent Receipts as being provided by a Data Subject to a Controller.</p>
        <p>For this document and the general use of DPV, we make no presumptions or enact restrictions on the use of records and receipts. Any entity, be it a Controller or a Data Subject, can maintain their own consent record or issue receipts. Though the phrasing of some sections may imply the Controller as the implementing entity, it does not preclude another entity from also implementing [[[ISO-27560]]].<p>

    <h2>Mapping 27560 to DPV and GDPR</h2>
    <p>The table below provides a comparison between the terms and concepts used in [[ISO-27560]], [[GDPR]], and [[DPV]]. It is neither exhaustive nor authoritative, and is provided as an informative resource to better understand and apply the concepts as they are expressed in the two normative documents ([[ISO-27560]] and [[GDPR]]). The column <i>req.?</i> reflects whether maintaining information on the concept is mandatory or optional. Where the value of this is expressed as a dash (<tt>-</tt>) it means <i>not applicable</i> to reflect the concept is not present or is covered by another term in the table. Note that for GDPR, the table only reflects the information to be maintained - either directly associated with the consent or elsewhere, and does not cover any specific requirements such as the validity of consent as per Art.4-11 or application of principles in Art.6.</p>

    <h2>27560-DPV Records</h2>
    <p class="issue" title="27560 record fields implemented using DPV"></p>
    <h3>Overview</h3>
    <p>A consent record, as defined earlier, is a documentation of information associated with consent. In [[ISO-27560]], a consent record contains four sections: <i>header</i> for specifying metadata regarding the record, <i>processing</i> containing information regarding the processing activities associated with that consent, <i>parties</i> for information on involved entities, and <i>events</i> for provenance of activities associated with that consent.</p>
    <p class="issue" title="Note on 27560 sections not being present in DPV">
    <p>In [[DPV]], the concept <code>ConsentRecord</code> represents a consent record. Due to way DPV is utilised and expressed (e.g. RDF graph, JSON) - there is no necessity to replicate the four sections of [[ISO-27560]] as information is linked and expressed as a single graph. Therefore, the DPV implementation using <code>ConsentRecord</code> only requires the existence of mandatory information fields and ignores the structuring into sections.</p>

    <h3>Header Fields</h3>
    <p class="issue" title="Table mapping 27560 header fields to DPV"></p>
    <p>The header fields represent metadata about the record and includes the following 3 fields:</p>
        <h4>Schema Version</h4>
            <p>the schema used to interpret the record and its information. For DPV, this is represented using <code>dct:conformsTo</code> with a reference to the schema ID or IRI. To represent the DPV consent record schema, the value of this field should be <code>https://w3id.org/dpv/schema/27560-record</code>. To represent the DPV GDPR consent record schema, the value of this field should be <code>https://w3id.org/dpv/schema/27560-GDPR-record</code>.</p>
            <p>This field MUST be present.</p>

            <aside class="example" title="schema version">
                <p>Using schema version</p>
                <pre><code>schema version</code></pre>
            </aside>

        <h4>Record Identifier</h4>
            <p>the unique identifier for this record. For DPV, this is represented using <code>dct:identifier</code> with a UUID-4 string as value. This field MUST be present in both [[27560]] and the DPV implementation.</p>

            <aside class="example" title="record identifier">
                <p>Using schema version</p>
                <pre><code>schema version</code></pre>
            </aside>

        <h4>Data Subject</h4>
            <p> the reference to data subject (pii principal id in [[ISO-27560]]) the consent record is about. For DPV, this is represented using <code>dpv:hasDataSubject</code> with an instance of <code>DataSubject</code> or a reference or identifier to an instance. This field MUST be present in both [[27560]] and the DPV implementation.</p>

            <aside class="example" title="data subject">
                <p>Using schema version</p>
                <pre><code>schema version</code></pre>
            </aside>

    <h3>Processing Fields</h3>
    <p class="issue" title="Table mapping 27560 processing fields to DPV"></p>
    <p class="issue" title="Should examples be added for each field?"></p>
    <p>[[ISO-27560]] contains 22 fields related to processing activities, and 5 additional fields regarding personal data involved in processing. The structuring of these fields within [[ISO-27560]] is of the form where the "PII Processing" section contains an array of "purposes" where each "purpose" is expressed with its own fields regarding legal basis, collection method, storage locations, and so on. Within the DPV implementation, this is replicated using <code>PersonalDataHandling</code> instances. Therefore, each of the below specified fields are used through an instance of <code>PersonalDataHandling</code>.</p>
        <h4>purpose</h4>
            <p>the purpose of processing personal data, expressed in DPV using <code>hasPurpose</code> as an instance of <code>Purpose</code>. This field MUST be present in both [[27560]] and the DPV implementation.</p>
        <h4>purpose type</h4>
            <p>the category of stated purpose, expressed in DPV by using concepts from <code>Purpose</code> taxonomy and associated with the purpose using <code>dct:type</code>. The purpose category provides a broad context to the purpose and aids in interoperability by providing a common framing through the taxonomy. This field MAY be present in [[ISO-27560]] implementations but MUST be present in DPV implementations.</p>
        <h4>legal basis</h4>
            <p>the legal basis (lawful basis in [[ISO-27560]] for processing of personal data. Though being a consent record, the legal basis field ensures that the processing is justified using consent, and also enables the consent record structure to be reused to other legal bases (e.g. contract) in the future. For the DPV implementation, this is expressed using <code>hasLegalBasis</code> with a concept from the <code>LegalBasis</code> taxonomy. For expressing jurisdiction specific legal basis, the appropriate extension should be used, for e.g. using consent types from [[DPV-GDPR]]. This field MAY be present in both [[ISO-27560]] and DPV implementation.</p>
        <h4>data controller(s)</h4>
            <p>the data controllers (pii controllers in [[ISO-27560]]) responsible for the specified processing activities, expressed in DPV by using <code>hasDataController</code> with instances of <code>DataController</code>. This field MUST be present in both [[ISO-27560]] and DPV implementations.</p>
        <h4>service(s)</h4>
            <p>the services this processing activities are part of or assist with, expressed in DPV using <code>hasService</code> and an instance of <code>Service</code>.<div class="issue" title="Service is a proposed concept in DPV"></div> This field MAY be present in both [[ISO-27560]] and DPV implementations.</p>
        <h4>personal data</h4>
            <p>the personal data (pii information in [[ISO-27560]]) associated with processing activities, expressed in DPV using <code>hasPersonalData</code> with <code>PersonalData</code>. This field MUST be present in both [[ISO-27560]] and DPV implementations. In [[ISO-27560]], the personal data fields are additionally describe the nature of personal data as follows:</p>

            <div class="issue" title="Using dct:type to specify categories instead of rdf:type">
                <p>In the fields here, <code>dct:type</code> is used to denote types or categories, e.g. for purposes and personal data, instead of the typical RDF semantics which use <code>rdf:type</code>, <code>rdfs:subClassOf</code>, or even <code>skos:broader/skos:narrower</code>. This is because using any of these implies a specific interpretation of categories, which may not be compatible with the rest of the information. For example, expressing category using <code>rdf:type</code> would make it an instance of that category which it may not necessarily be. If a specific DPV profile is being used, then it can opt to use the appropriate semantic relation in addition to the one used here.</p></div>
            <ul>
            <li><b><i>type</i></b>: the type or category of personal data (pii type in [[ISO-27560]]), expressed in DPV using <code>dct:type</code>, and optionally using concepts from the [[DPV-PD]] taxonomy. This field MUST be present in both [[ISO-27560]] and DPV implementations.</li>
            <li><b><i>identifier</i></b>: an identifier representing the data values or instances e.g. within a database, expressed in DPV using <code>dct:identifier</code>. This field MAY be present in both [[ISO-27560]] and DPV implementations.</li>
            <li><b><i>necessity</i></b>: the necessity or optionality of this data (pii optional in [[ISO-27560]]) for the processing, expressed in DPV using <code>hasNecessity</code> and one of the provided instances of <code>Necessity</code>. This field MAY be present in both [[ISO-27560]] and DPV implementation, and its absence is to be interpreted as meaning the data is necessary.</li>
            <li><b><i>sensitive personal data</i></b>: whether the personal data is considered sensitive (sensitive pii category in [[ISO-27560]]), denoted in DPV by using <code>dct:type</code> with value <code>SensitivePersonalData</code>. This field MAY be present in both [[ISO-27560]] and DPV implementations.</li>
            <li><b><i>special category personal data</i></b>: whether the personal data belongs to one of special categories based on jurisdictional regulations such as GDPR (special pii category in [[ISO-27560]]). It is expressed in DPV implementations by using <code>dct:type</code> with value <code>SpecialCategoryPersonalData</code>. This field MAY be present in both [[ISO-27560]] and DPV implementations.</li>

    <h3>Security and Privacy</h3>
    <p class="issue" title="write security considerations"></p>
    <ul>
    <li>record is personal data - information within a consent record and the record itself also constitutes personal data, therefore appropriate measures are required to safeguard it</li>
    <li>identification for record/receipt - each consent must be attributed to the data subject it is about, however this does not mean records and receipts require additional identification procedures to get this information. Where no identity or identifier is available, a new identifier should be created for the purposes of record/receipt only e.g. visitors to the website</li>
    <li>integrity of contents - mechanisms such as using cryptographic hashes to provide integrity checks for information, ensuring storage retains accuracy of information, and any changes to structure of information should be assessed to ensure interpretation of contents of records/receipts is not changed</li>
    <li>verification of contents - disputes on changes in contents and discrepancies between records or receipts held by two or more entities are possible; mechanisms to cryptopgraphically 'sign' the information using verifiable means can assist in preventing such issues. The current norm within 27560 is Controllers creating records and providing receipts to the data subjects who can then use it to keep their own records. This guide does not presume this is the only possible use-case, and considers any entity</li>
    <li>transmission / communication - between controllers</li>
    <li>communication of receipt to data subjects</li>
    </ul>
</section>

<section id="modelling-considerations" >
    <h3>Information Modelling</h3>
    <p class="issue" title="write information modeling considerations"></p>
    <ul>
    <li>for controllers - storing full records/receipts is not required</li>
    <li>for controllers - separate records or single records</li>
    <li>for controllers - updating vs appending</li>
    <li>for data subjects - creating own records</li>
    <li>for data subjects - storing and using receipts</li>

    <h3>Additional Schemas and Profiles</h3>
    <p class="issue" title="write possible future schemas"></p>
    <ul>
    <li>records - GDPR specific, notice only i.e. only mention the notice and record
    consent events (the notice has to be 27560 conformant) </li>
    <li>receipts - A13/A14, signals only, full+explicit i.e. mention not applicable
    in fields instead of blanks</li>
