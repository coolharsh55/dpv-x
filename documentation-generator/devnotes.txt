- 001_download script now uses a try...catch block to continue downloading other sheets if one causes an error
- Scripts and templates updated to incorporate Entities and Risk modules
- Updated DPV to v5
- DPV-SKOS: fixed issue where certain concepts were not expressed as subclasses (e.g. ProcessingContext -> Context) using the "sc__" notation in spreadsheet. Updated HTML documentation which shows subclass if applies, else narrower than if applies - in that order.
