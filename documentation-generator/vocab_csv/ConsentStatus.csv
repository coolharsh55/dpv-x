"ConsentStatus","Consent Status","The state or status of 'consent' that provides information reflecting its operational status and validity for processing data","dpv:Status","sc","","","","States are useful as information artefacts to implement them in controlling processing, and to reflect the process and flow of obtaining and maintaining consent. For example, a database table that stores consent states for specific processing and can be queried to obtain them in an efficient manner. States are also useful in investigations to determine the use and validity of consenting practices","(GConsent,https://w3id.org/GConsent)","2022-06-22","","accepted","Georg P Krog, Harshvardhan J.

"ConsentRequestDeferred","Consent Request Deferred","State where a request for consent has been deferred without a decision","dpv:ConsentStatusInvalidForProcessing","a","","","","An example of this state is when the individual closes or dismisses a notice without making a decision. This state is intended for making the distinction between a notice being provided (as a consent request) and the individual interacting with the notice without making a decision - where the 'ignoring of a notice' is taken as consent being neither given nor refused","(GConsent,https://w3id.org/GConsent)","2022-06-22","","accepted","Georg P Krog, Harshvardhan J.

"ConsentWithdrawn","Consent Withdrawn","The state where the consent is withdrawn or revoked specifically by the data subject and which prevents it from being further used as a valid state","dpv:ConsentStatusInvalidForProcessing","a","","","","This state can be considered a form of 'revocation' of consent, where the revocation can only be performed by the data subject.
