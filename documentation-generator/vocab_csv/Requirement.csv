"R3","Provide concepts as a dictionary or thesauri with contextual parts","The concepts should be bundled together and provided as a vocabulary or thesauri with distinct parts or sections (or sub-vocabularies) that relate to specific contextual details. For example, providing purposes as a separate taxonomy enables use of only purposes elsewhere.","","","U3","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""
