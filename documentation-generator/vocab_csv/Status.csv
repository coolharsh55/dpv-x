"AuditConditionallyApproved","Audit Conditionally Approved","State of being conditionally approved through the audit","dpv:AuditStatus","a","","","","A ""conditional approval"" is intended to reflect states where the audit has identified further changes which must be implemented before considering the audit has been 'passed', without requiring another audit to validate them. This is distinct from the case where an audit has state 'rejected', which means changes must be made and submitted for review. The requirements of a 'conditional acceptance' are expected to be minor or not significant enough to warrant another audit to review them.","","2022-06-29","","accepted","Paul Ryan","https://www.w3.org/2022/06/29-dpvcg-minutes.html","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""
