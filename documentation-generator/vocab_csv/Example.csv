"E0003","Extending Purpose for Use-Case","DPV defines the (broad) concept Marketing in its Purpose hierarchy to represent information about (purposes related to) marketing activities and topics. For a use-case which requires representing purposes (note: plural) related to marketing of new products, the broad Marketing concept is extended as a child or subclass concept for representing the intended purpose as, e.g. MarketingNewProducts.","E0003.ttl","dpvs:Purpose","ref","Y","2022-10-13","Harsh","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

"E0005","Combining concepts to indicate they always occur together","Consider the use-case where an activity simultaneously uses the data while collecting it. The first representation (<code>ActivityA</code>) models them separately - which is not accurate as it is ambiguous in terms of collection and usage taking place independently. By extending the collect and use concepts to create a new concept called <code>CollectAndUse</code>, it is possible to accurately declare that they both occur as a concurrent operation. Such combinations of concepts are also useful to collectively represent or annotate additional information such as: technologies involved, implementation details, or agents involved","E0005.ttl","dpv:Concept,dpv:Processing","ref","Y","2022-10-13","Harsh","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""
"E0006","Maintaining Interoperability between Use-Cases","For example, two TV companies (<code>AliceCo</code> and <code>BobCo</code>) extend the concept <code>Optimisation</code> to reflect their respective purposes. When exchanging information about their use-cases with each other (or with a third party), by following the chain of use-case specific concepts it is possible to deduce that both <code>AliceCo</code> and <code>BobCo</code> are doing optimisations for consumers. Thus a common language or interface can be developed based on using DPV as a point of interoperability and commonality which can be used by adopters to define the specifics of their use-case. For example, in the above use-case, a common notice generation algorithm could be created and used to inform users of both services the purposes each company is using data for.","E0006.ttl","dpv:Concept,dpv:Purpose","ref","Y","2022-10-13","Harsh","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""
"E0007","Use of PersonalDataHandling to group how data is being processed","For an example of how <code>PersonalDataHandling</code> brings together the core concepts, consider the example where <code>Acme</code> is a <code>DataController</code> that <code>Collect</code>(s) and <code>Use</code>(s) <code>Email</code> for <code>ServiceProvision</code>.","E0007.ttl","dpv:PersonalDataHandling","ref","Y","2022-10-13","Harsh","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In this, it collects email, uses it for internal analyses based on <em>LegitimateInterests</em>, and also sends marketing information by using a processor based on the data subject's consent. Using nesting of personal data handling, the information can be expressed at granular level representing service, individual purposes, and so on.","E0008.ttl","dpv:PersonalDataHandling","ref","Y","2022-10-13","Harsh","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""
"E0009","Adding human-readable descriptions","In this example, a new purpose is created by extending <code>dpv:FraudPreventionAndDetection</code> and annotated with human-readable information. The interpretation of this purpose is thus more clear in relation to how it is applied or used within that use-case, and also serves to compare it with other purposes within the same category.","E0009.ttl","dpv:Concept,dpv:Purpose","ref","Y","2022-10-13","Harsh","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

"E0013","Automated Processing with Human Involvement","Consider the use of a spam filter that is based on automated processing operations where humans provide inputs, have oversight of the operation, and results in automated decision making for whether communications should be propogated. A new separate filter is developed that utilises a novel spam detection criteria that also takes into account communications other than emails for the sender and makes automated decisions whether to permit communication to proceed. Such explicit annotation of several high-risk operations assists in performing impact assessments for this technology, as well as understanding the extent and effectiveness of human involvement to mitigate risks and issues.","E0013.ttl","dpv:ProcessingAutomation,dpv:HumanInput","ref","Y","2022-10-13","Harsh","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""
