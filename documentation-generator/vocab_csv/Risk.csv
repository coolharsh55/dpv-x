"RiskLevel","Risk Level","The magnitude of a risk expressed as an indication to aid in its management","dpv:Concept","a","","","","Risk Levels can be defined as a combination of different characteristics. For example, ISO 31073:2022 defines it as a combination of consequences and their likelihood. Another example would be the Risk Matrix where Risk Level is defined as a combination of Likelihood and Severity associated with the Risk.","","2022-07-20","","accepted","Harshvardhan J.

"Likelihood","Likelihood","The likelihood or probability or chance of something taking place or occuring","dpv:Concept","a","","","","Likelihood can be expressed in a subjective manner, such as 'Unlikely', or in a quantitative manner such as ""Twice in a Day"" (frequency per period). The suggestion is to use quantitative values, or to associate them with subjective terms used so as to enable accurate interpretations and interoperability. See the concepts related to Frequency and Duration for possible uses as a combination to express Likelihood.","","2022-07-22","","accepted","Harshvardhan J.
