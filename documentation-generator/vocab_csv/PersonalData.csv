Failing this condition, the data should be denoted as PseudoAnonymisedData. To indicate data is anonymised only for a specified entity (e.g. within an organisation), the concept AnonymisedDataWithinScope (as subclass of PseudoAnonymisedData) should be used instead of AnonymisedData.","","2022-01-19","","accepted","Piero Bonatti","https://www.w3.org/community/dpvcg/wiki/MinutesOfMeeting_20220119","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

"SensitivePersonalData","SensitivePersonalData","Personal data that is considered 'sensitive' in terms of privacy and/or impact, and therefore requires additional considerations and/or protection","dpv:PersonalData","","","Sensitivity' is a matter of context, and may be defined within legal frameworks. For GDPR, Special categories of personal data are considered a subset of sensitive data. To illustrate the difference between the two, consider the situation where Location data is collected, and which is considered 'sensitive' but not 'special'. As a probable rule, sensitive data require additional considerations whereas special category data requires additional legal basis / justifications.","","2022-01-19","","accepted","Harshvardhan J.
