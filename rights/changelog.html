This means if there are no major issues raised and unable to be resolved, including missing parts, errors or bugs, or requirements that must be added, then after 15-OCT-2022, this version will be re-released as DPV v1.0 along with any further enhancements, fixes, minor additions, or documentations that have been developed until then.</blockquote>
